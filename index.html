        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="indented">
            This project is a virtual assistant designed to schedule, track, record, and analyze events according to user design. The
            user can schedule events in a specific or recurring manner and view them from a calendar. These scheduled events are
            connected to an interface the user can design for recording the information they choose upon completing the event. The
            recording feature is designed to work without scheduled events as well, allowing the user to record more spontaneous
            activity. The data from these events will be stored and accessible en masse for analysis of time usage and comparisons
            specific to the properties the user chooses to record. The user will be required to log in, only allowing each user to
            access their own information.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            This assistant improves the productivity of individuals in business and personal settings through its quick and flexible
            design. The user can swiftly organize themselves and design each detail to their specific needs. Choice of properties to
            record allows the user to organize the information recorded about each event for easy analysis later. Requiring the user
            to log in ensures security for each user's personal data. The ability to record actions and analyze time expenditure as
            well as specific properties provides the user with an easy method of analyzing data about their time and specifically
            recorded information to make informed decisions on how to solve user-specific problems and promote a balanced lifestyle.
