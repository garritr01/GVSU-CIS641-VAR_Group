Time: 10:00AM - 10:40AM 

Discussion points: 
* Tools for implementation of frontend, backend, querying, databasing, and domain name acquisition.
* Frontend (deploy straight from github repo)
    * Vercel
    * Netlify
* Backend
    * Gunicorn Procfile
    * Alter querying addresses
* Database
    * SQLite not ideal for concurrency
    * Move to MySQL or Postgre SQL
* Domain names are relatively cheap (Namecheap or Google Domains)

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
* Garrit complete initial modeling, so we can complete modeling together a week behind schedule
