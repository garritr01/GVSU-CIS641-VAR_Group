# Introduction

The project is a virtual assistant designed to schedule, track, record, and analyze events according to user design. The user can schedule events in a specific or recurring manner and view them from a calendar. These scheduled events are connected to an interface the user can design for recording the information they choose upon completing the event. The recording feature is designed to work without scheduled events as well, allowing the user to record more spontaneous activity. The data from these events will be stored and accessible en masse for analysis of time usage and comparisons specific to the properties the user chooses to record. The user will be required to log in, only allowing each user to access their information. 

This assistant improves the productivity of individuals in business and personal settings through its quick and flexible design. The user can swiftly organize themselves and design each detail to their specific needs. Choice of properties to record allows the user to organize the information recorded about each event for easy analysis later. Requiring the user to log in ensures security for each user's personal data. The ability to record actions and analyze time expenditure as well as specific properties provides the user with an easy method of analyzing data about their time and specifically recorded information to make informed decisions on how to solve user-specific problems and promote a balanced lifestyle.

# Anticipated Technologies

* Oracle database
* SQLite
* Flask
* Python
* React
* JSX (JavaScript/HTML hybrid)

# Method/Approach

The project is already partially complete, but was designed on the fly resulting in many inefficiencies and bugs. The well-documented, effective APIs will be retained, but the front end will be rewritten and the database structure may be altered according to the needs of each feature. We will compile the requirements, and model the flows of data to determine the optimal feature design and database structure. We will also determine how to deploy the framework to the web. Based on our findings, changes to SQLite will be made and features will begin development. These features will be testable during development, allowing us to confirm their usability. Upon completion of features, final check testing will be conducted. When the final testing is complete, the framework will be deployed to the web, and available to those interested in taking advantage of this new tool.

# Estimated Timeline

* Complete modeling and finalize the choice of database and querying by Oct 14
* Implement database changes by Oct 21
* Complete feature design by Nov 18
* Complete final testing by Nov 25
* Deploy to the web by Dec 7

# Anticipated Problems

* Ease of use - The assistant must be quick to use to promote consistent entry from the user as the quantity of data recorded and scheduled directly affects the usefulness provided by the project.
* Complexity - The assistant must be well understood by the user, so their interface design is optimal for analyzing insights they desire.
* Security - The user's data must be secure, as it is personal in nature and easily taken advantage of by malicious actors if acquired.
* Deployment - The assistant must be deployable to the web, requiring up-front research to guarantee this program will work beyond the local host.
