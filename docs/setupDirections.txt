1. Get WSL2 and set up with ubuntu
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#prerequisites
2. Install nvm: 
    $curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
3. Put follwing code in ~/.bashrc
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
4. Restart ubuntu.
5. Install Node.js with nvm:
    $nvm install --lts ($nvm -use --lts    [if you had old version])
6. Confirm you have npm and node:
    $npm -v
    $node -v

#7+ might not work I havent tried it in a while
7. Pull main branch to local
8. Download flask dependecies:
    $pip install -r src/flask/requirements.txt
9. Route to src/whateverWeNameOurProject.
10. Create app (takes some time, c)
    $npx create-react-app yourAppName
11. Open in development build:
    $npm start
12. Now you should see a webpage on your browser at localhost's port 3000
    and you can take a look around, but the database won't work yet.


Note to self try not to use CORS (browsers don't like)
