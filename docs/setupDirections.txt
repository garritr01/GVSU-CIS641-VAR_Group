1. Get WSL2 and set up with ubuntu
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#prerequisites
2. Install nvm: 
    $curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
3. Put follwing code in ~/.bashrc file
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
4. Restart ubuntu.
5. Install Node.js with nvm:
    $nvm install --lts ($nvm -use --lts    [if you had old version])
6. Confirm you have npm and node:
    $npm -v
    $node -v
7. Pull main branch to local at the desired location.
8. Create virtual environment.
    # retrieve updated package lists
        $sudo apt update
    # install venv
        $sudo apt install python3-venv
    # create venv (will be created in current directory):
    # I recommend you name it flaskVenv as this name is already in .gitignore and will not be included in anything pushed to github
        $python3 -m venv nameOfYourVirtualEnvironment
    # activate your virtual environment
        $source nameOfYourVirtualEnvironment/bin/activate
9. Download flask dependecies (do this within virtual environment) (this takes some time, let me know if it fails):
    # install required packages if you have not already (if you have you may want to update)
    $sudo apt install pkg-config build-essential python3-dev libatlas-base-dev liblapack-dev gfortran
    # install project's python dependencies
    $pip install -r src/flask/requirements.txt
10. Start backend.
    $python3 src/flask/src/flaskAndSQL.py
11. Open a new terminal and install dependencies for frontend:
    $cd ROSA
    $npm install
12. Open in development build:
    $npm start
13. Browser will open development server at http://localhost:3000/
